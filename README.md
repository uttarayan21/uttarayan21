![Metrics](https://github.com/uttarayan21/uttarayan21/blob/main/github-metrics.svg)

Iâ€™m currently an Intern at rapidinnovation.io.  
I love foss and try to actively contribute to projects.

I have been using linux for 6 years.  
Currently I use [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org) (the aur is awesome) with bspwm and my dotfiles are [here](https://github.com/uttarayan21/dotfiles).

[rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is my favourite language.  

You can reach me on my [email](mailto:email@uttarayan.me).
