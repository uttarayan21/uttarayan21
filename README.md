### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently a student studying computer science in college.
My hobby is fiddling with linux and writing small programs.

I have been using linux for 6 years so I have picked up a few things here and there.

Iâ€™m currently working on a small [snake](https://github.com/uttarayan21/snake) game using rust and ncurses.

Iâ€™m currently learning [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and I hate that I love it.
Iâ€™m also learning about networking and so I can deploy my own IoT devices (for now).

Fun fact: My name means Northern [Solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice) in my native language.
