### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently a student studying computer science in college.
My hobby is fiddling with linux and writing small programs.

I have been using linux for 6 years so I have picked up a few things here and there.
I use [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org) with bspwm and my dotfiles are [here](https://github.com/uttarayan21/dotfiles).

Iâ€™m currently working on a small [snake](https://github.com/uttarayan21/snake) game using rust and ncurses.

Iâ€™m currently learning [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) I love it.
Iâ€™m also learning about networking and so I can deploy my own IoT devices (for now).

You can reach me on twitter or my email.

Fun fact
My name means Northern [Solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice) in my native language.
I also love to play guitar.
