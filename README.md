Iâ€™m currently an Intern at rapidinnovation.io.  
I love foss and try to actively contribute to projects.

I have been using linux for 6 years.  
Currently I use [ArchLinux][archlinux] (the aur is awesome) with bspwm and my dotfiles are [here](https://github.com/uttarayan21/dotfiles).

[rust][rust] is my favourite language.  
I'm currently learning [solana][solana] and blockchain in general.

You can reach me on my [email][email].
