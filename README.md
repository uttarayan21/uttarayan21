I’m currently a student studying computer science in college.  
I love foss and try to actively contribute to projects.

I have been using linux for 6 years.  
Currently I use [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org) (the aur is awesome) with bspwm and my dotfiles are [here](https://github.com/uttarayan21/dotfiles).

I’m currently learning [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  

You can reach me on my [email](mailto:uttarayan21@disroot.org).
