### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently a student studying computer science in college.  
My hobby is writing software.

I have been using linux for 6 years.  
Currently I use [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org) (the aur is awesome) with bspwm and my dotfiles are [here](https://github.com/uttarayan21/dotfiles).

Iâ€™m currently learning [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  
I'm also learning how to use vectors to represent 2d graphics on html canvas. I want to make a simple 2d graphics engine in wasm(rust) to draw simple stuff.

I am also learning wasm and react with typescript.

You can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/uttarayan21) or my email.

Fun fact
My name means Northern [Solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice) in my native language.
I also love to play guitar.
